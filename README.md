# Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Optimization System

## Overview

This project presents an end-to-end system for assisting in cancer diagnosis and optimized treatment planning. It combines machine learning techniques for early cancer detection with quantum optimization methods to personalize and improve treatment strategies.

The workflow is organized into four main stages:

---

## System Workflow

### 1. Patient Cell Data Collection
- **Input:** Biological cell parameters from patients.
- **Purpose:** Gather necessary data features (e.g., size, texture, perimeter) for diagnosis.

---

### 2. Cancer Diagnosis Classifier (Machine Learning)
- **Input:** Patient cell parameters.
- **Output:** 
  - `1` ‚Üí Cancer detected (Positive)
  - `0` ‚Üí No cancer detected (Healthy)
- **Description:** A trained ML model classifies whether the input data suggests the presence of cancer.

---

### 3. Quantum Optimization for Beam Angle Selection
- **Trigger:** Executed **only if cancer is detected**.
- **Process:**
  - Formulate the beam angle selection problem as a **QUBO** (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) problem.
  - Solve using **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)**.
  - Perform classical post-processing to refine and validate the results.
- **Purpose:** Find the optimal radiation beam angles for therapy, minimizing damage to healthy tissues while maximizing impact on the tumor.

---

### 4. Recommended Treatment Plan
- **Output:** Personalized, optimized treatment plan based on quantum-classical hybrid computation results.
- **Goal:** Offer an effective and precise treatment recommendation to improve patient outcomes.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning:** Cancer classification based on patient cell data.
- **Quantum Computing:** QUBO formulation and QAOA for optimization tasks.
- **Classical Computing:** Post-processing optimization results.
- **Medical Data Processing:** Handling and interpreting biological parameters.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Expand dataset to include multiple cancer types.
- Integrate more quantum algorithms for other treatment parameters.
- Improve classical-quantum hybrid processing pipeline.
- Add explainability modules for ML predictions to increase trust and transparency.
